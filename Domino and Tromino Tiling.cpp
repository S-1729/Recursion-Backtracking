/*
	You have two types of tiles: a 2 x 1 domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.
	Given an integer n, return the number of ways to tile an 2 x n board. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
	In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.

	Example 1:
	Input: n = 3
	Output: 5
	
	Example 2:
	Input: n = 1
	Output: 1
	
	T.C : O(n)
