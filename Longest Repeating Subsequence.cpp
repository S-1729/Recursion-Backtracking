/*
	Given string str, find the length of the longest repeating subsequence such that it can be found twice in the given string.
	The two identified subsequences A and B can use the same ith character from string str if and only if that ith character has different indices in A and B. 
	For example, A = "xax" and B = "xax" then the index of first "x" must be different in the original string for A and B.
	
	Example 1:
	Input:
	str = "axxzxy"
	Output: 2
	Explanation:
	The given array with indexes looks like
	a x x z x y 
	0 1 2 3 4 5
	The longest subsequence is "xx". 
	It appears twice as explained below.

	Example 2:
	Input:
	str = "axxxy"
	Output: 2
	Explanation:
	The given array with indexes looks like
	a x x x y 
	0 1 2 3 4
	The longest subsequence is "xx". 
	It appears twice as explained below.
