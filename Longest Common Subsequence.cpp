/*
	Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
	A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
		.For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
	A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
	
	Example 1:
	Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
	Output: 3  
	Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
	
	Example 2:	
	Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
	Output: 3
	Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
	
	Example 3:	
	Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
	Output: 0
	Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
